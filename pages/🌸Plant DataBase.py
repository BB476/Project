This plant grows in very narrow microhabitats inside the study area (the only site for this species all over the world) with estimated EOO less than 300 km2. This species is severely threatened by both natural (aridity of the area and climate change) and human factors (Over collection, scientific research, and over-grazing). All these factors are pushing it to the brink of extinction, however the plant has many medical uses due to it containing flavanoids that  showed significant antioxidant activity, anticancer and antitumor activity, hepatoprotective activity, anti-inflammatory activity, anti-diabetes activity, antiviral activity, antibacterial and antifungal activity, and other biological effects.
